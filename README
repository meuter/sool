SOOL : Simple Object Orientation Library in C

This project aims at providing a simple object orientation framework for the C language, as well as a comprehensive collection of modern data structure found in higher level like lists, sets, dictionary,
etc. The techniques used in the library are greatly inspired by a book by Axel-Tobias Schreiner that I recommend for anyone who wants a thorough understanding of how object oriented languages work.
The book is called "Object Oriented Programming in ANSI-C" and is available on his website:

This project is still in its infancy and will grow as time permits.
