SOOL : Simple Object Orientation Library in C

This project aims at providing a simple object orientation
framework for the C language, as well as a comprehensive 
collection of modern data structure found in higher level 
languages like lists, sets, dictionary, exception,etc.
The techniques used in the library are greatly inspired 
by the excellent book by Axel-Tobias Schreiner called 
"Object Oriented Programming in ANSI-C". This book is 
available on his website:

(thanks to Nicolas M. for showing this to me!)

This project is still in its infancy and will grow as time
permits.
